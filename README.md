Here you know two type DSA prefix sum method

Prefix sum 1 method Question
```ruby

Given an integer array A with size N and an integer Q for queries, where 0< N,Q < 10^6.
Write a program using prefix sum concept to find the sum of a given range L to R for each query. (1 <= L,R <= N and L <= R)
N
A1 A2 A3…….AN
Q
L1  R1
L2  R2
.    .
.     .
LQ  RQ
Sample input:
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
3
1 3

Prefix Sum Method 2 Question

```ruby

Given an integer array A with size N and an integer Q for queries, where
(0 <  N < 10^5) , (-10^7 < Ai  < 10^7) and (0 < Q < 10^7) .
Write a program using prefix sum concept to find the sum of positive integers from a given range L to R for each query. (1 <= L,R <= N)

N
